# Bookprep

## Introduction

This CLI PHP script rearranges local digitized book structure, files, and directories to islandora book_batch form
also creates derivatives for jp2, ocr, hocr.

1. At start up, does a system check and will list requirements and exit if they do not exist.
2. The given directory is checked for files in the proper format and a list of errors will be printed and the program will exit if the format is wrong.
3. When the input files are properly formatted, bookprep will:
  - remove misc housekeeping files from other programs, currently `".DS_Store, ._*"`
  - convert tifs to jp2 or jp2 to tifs
  - convert jp2s to tif and make ocr then delete the tif if the object file is meant to be a jp2
  - make OCR and HOCR, corrects the tesseract 3.04 action of the HOCR step also making OCR.


## Requirements

1. Linux command line on server
2. Tesseract - version 3.02, 3.03, or 3.04
3. KDU_expand and kdu_compress
4. ImageMagick (convert)
5. xmllint

### To use with bookprep.sh comment out LINE 364 (this can be fixed later so the php does not need to be modified)
After bookprep checks the files it ask for a user to type 'Y' to proceed. Skipping this step is needed when using the bookprep.sh file. From within the php file change __line 364__ from

```php
...
364 $input=fgetc(STDIN);
365 if (($input!='y')&&($input!='Y')) {
366   print "*---------------------\n";
367   print "* Bookprep is exiting.\n";
368   print "*---------------------\n";
369   exit();
370 } //else will continue below
...
```

__To__ this
```php
...
364 $input='y';
365 if (($input!='y')&&($input!='Y')) {
366   print "*---------------------\n";
367   print "* Bookprep is exiting.\n";
368   print "*---------------------\n";
369   exit();
370 } //else will continue below
...
```

## Use

Run as a shell command

Example:
```bash
./bookprep.php

$ Where are the images (absolute path): /gwork/don/test_book_images
$ Where is the metadata files (absolute path): /gwork/don/test_book_metadata
```

To use the bookprep.sh file.
```bash

$./bookprep.sh

Starting...

$ Where are the images (absolute path): /gwork/don/test_book_images
$ Where is the metadata files (absolute path): /gwork/don/test_book_metadata
```

## Details

Start with standard directory form for books.

**Example of what it should look like before running Bookprep**
```terminal
example/
├── example-vol1-no1
│   ├── example-vol1-no1_0001.tif
│   ├── example-vol1-no1_0002.tif
│   ├── example-vol1-no1_0003.tif
│   └── example-vol1-no1_0004.tif
├── example-vol1-no1.xml
├── example-vol1-no2
│   ├── example-vol1-no2_0001.tif
│   ├── example-vol1-no2_0002.tif
│   └── example-vol1-no2_0003.tif
├── example-vol1-no2.xml
├── example-vol2-no1
│   ├── example-vol2-no1_0001.tif
│   ├── example-vol2-no1_0002.tif
│   ├── example-vol2-no1_0003.tif
│   ├── example-vol2-no1_0004.tif
│   └── example-vol2-no1_0005.tif
└── example-vol2-no1.xml
```

[a collection directory]
--- [with item directories] inside of it
--- and xml files for the items outside of the item directories
------ page image files are all inside of each item directory

Filenames of pages have to be separated with at least one _

as in:

roth_001.tif

or

comm_2005jan_0001.tif

or

0012_002345_000211_001.tif

The item directories and xml filenames have one less section than the
image file names.

The page files have an integer number ( with leading zeros)
representing the sequence. This is separated and coverted to an integer to be the page number.

If the files and directories are not arranged  and named like this,
the script will not work. It should exit and give alist of what is not formatted correctly, but there are no garantees. Keep a copy of the directory you start with in case you have to stop part way through.

The script makes a MODS.xml for the page with title being read from item xml in directory above
like (title : page 2) and puts it in each page directory.

**Example of directory structure after bookprep**

This example is only displaying one of the 3 subdirectories. The others should look similar.
```terminal
example/
├── example-vol1-no1
│   ├── 1
│   │   ├── HOCR.html
│   │   ├── MODS.xml
│   │   ├── OBJ.tif
│   │   └── OCR.txt
│   ├── 2
│   │   ├── HOCR.html
│   │   ├── MODS.xml
│   │   ├── OBJ.tif
│   │   └── OCR.txt
│   ├── 3
│   │   ├── HOCR.html
│   │   ├── MODS.xml
│   │   ├── OBJ.tif
│   │   └── OCR.txt
│   ├── 4
│   │   ├── HOCR.html
│   │   ├── MODS.xml
│   │   ├── OBJ.tif
│   │   └── OCR.txt
│   └── MODS.xml
├── example-vol1-no1.xml
├── example-vol1-no2
│   └── ...
├── example-vol1-no2.xml
├── example-vol2-no1
│   └── ...
└── example-vol2-no1.xml
```

### Bookprep.sh
Is a wrapper for bookprep.php to simulate a multithreading process. The steps it takes are

 - initial                 - Looks for a config file
 - ask_user                - Ask user for where the images and metadata is located.
 - config-file-generated   - Creates a directory to process the files in and a .config file to store the last know step.
 - init_copies             -> copy the images/metadata into the processing directory.
 - init_copies_complete    - checks if the images & metadata have finished copying.
 - move_to_processing      - Preps the directory to process each child directory with it's own instance of bookprep.php
 - processing              -> Process the pages with bookprep.php 100 at a time.
 - processing-complete     - Checks that the pages have completed without errors and all expected files are present (OCR, HOCR,etc.).
 - cleanup-files-staging   -> move the files back to the expected structure for ingestion.
 - moving-file-to-staging  -> Moving the files to staging directory.
 - check-staging-move      - Check to see if staging move is complete.
 - complete                - print to screen message to inform user and exit.

This file can be started, stopped and resumed at almost any time. It will give you a message when it's safe to exit. It will loop every 30 seconds to update the user and to test if the next step is ready.

#### Stop all screen session
This will stop __"ALL"__ screen sessions by this user.
```bash
$ bookprep.sh stop
```

### Known BUG
This line may need to be commented out for now
```php
$out=`kdu_compress -v 2>&1`;
if (strstr($out,'version v6')) {
